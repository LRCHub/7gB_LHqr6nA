Won't you please forgive me?
Forgive me
I heard the tales
Of the secret way
That tears are replacements
For what has been taken away
From us and the lost
Still, all I see is burning fields
Still, all I hear is dying screams
Am I who I should be?
For all that you are
Lies only within me
I am the future
I am the past
I am what you wish for
The god you wish to be
I am the voice
Behind the silent scream
I am the dark
And the light you'll never see
I am the blood
That makes your soul free
I am pure
I am unclean
It takes one to be a god
It takes one to feel lonely
It takes two to outlast me
It takes two to feel complete
It takes a moon to light the stars
It takes a light to see the dark
Insanity reached
Whispering voice
The sky above the stars
The wind below the moon
The light created shadows
The dark beyond the eyes
I sat before myself
I looked above below
